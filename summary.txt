SUMMARY OF DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING (Task 1)

Dataset: Customer Personality Analysis (Sample Data)
Tool Used: Microsoft Excel

1. Removed Duplicates:
   - I identified and removed a duplicate row for customer ID 1006 (which is the same as ID 1001).

2. Handled Missing Values:
   - Two missing values in the 'Income' column (IDs 1002 and 1012) were filled using the average of the available incomes.

3. Standardized Text Values:
   - Gender values converted to "Male" and "Female" (e.g., M, F, m, f → Male/Female).
   - Education values are standardized to "Graduation", "Master", and "PhD".
   - Marital_Status standardized to proper cases (e.g., "married" → "Married").

4. Fixed Date Formats:
   - All dates in the 'Dt_Customer' column converted to uniform format: DD-MM-YYYY.

5. Renamed Columns:
   - Changed column headers to lowercase with underscores for consistency:
     - Marital_Status → marital_status
     - Year_Birth → year_birth
     - Dt_Customer → date_customer
     (etc.)

Notes:
- All changes were done manually using Excel filters, formulas, and formatting tools.
- Screenshots (if included) demonstrate the steps visually.
